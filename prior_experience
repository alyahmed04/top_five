  - I don't have any CI/CD experience, as I have never had the oppertunity to work in real world development. I hope that I get to gain experience
  with a system that needs real time maitinane in the futurue, but for now I am just learning. 


Prior CI/CD experience: Aly Ahmed:
My experience with CI is with my internship over the summer, where I worked with Azure DevOps. When a pull request was made, 
automated tests would run against my changes to see if they would break parts of the application upon deployment. 
These tests would consist of unit tests written in the application, and if my changes did not have a fully passing set of unit tests, the build would fail.
